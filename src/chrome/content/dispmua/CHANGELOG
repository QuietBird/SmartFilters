1.1.2   2005-09-03
- Thomas Bertels <the_redburn@perso.be> sent me a localized
  version of dispMUA, including french and the original english
  locale. He also told me that I can use OptiPNG to make the
  pngs smaller; so I reduced the icons from 272kiB size to 255kiB.
- Made the "mostwanted" icons to be searched only at the beginning
  of the identifier
- Went back from mostwanted, replaced it with "presearch" which is
  searched full (not only at the beginning) as there were problems
  with thunderbird identification
- There is a ChangeLog file now
- xhtmail [http://ptaff.ca/xhtmail/] uses the dispMUA icons
- gnus-muaicon.el [http://www.geocities.jp/emacsjjjj/gnus/]
  is a dispMUA port to Gnus
